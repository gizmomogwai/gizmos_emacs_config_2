* My Emacs Config
- my config works on a set of activators
- most of the heavy lifting is done with el-get and customize so these
  activators are the most prominent ones
- package specific code is put (most of the time) into init-package.el
  files that are executed by el-get
- as view as possible customizations are done outside of this system

* Recent Additions
** DONE helm-occur on C-s
** DONE helm-for-file for C-x-f
